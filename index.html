This research examines the transformative impact of aerodynamics on a Formula 1 (F1) car development from the late 1800s to the FIA's establishment in 1950. 
It highlights the crucial role of aerodynamics, especially in the chassis and undercarriage streamlining, driving manufacturers to refine designs for superior
speed and efficiency. Emphasising aerodynamics' multifaceted impact on speed and fuel efficiency, the study analyses F1 car evolution through distinct eras, 
correlating aerodynamic advancements with racing success. Incorporating insights from Formula 1 aerodynamicist Adrian Newey, the research underscores the 
delicate balance between innovation and safety in aerodynamics, addressing potential risks. Concluding that aerodynamics is a top factor in F1 car competitiveness, 
the study anticipates continued evolution. It suggests manufacturers can enhance stability and create faster, streamlined cars by pushing aerodynamic boundaries.

Formula 1 has always stood as a fiercely competitive and exhilarating game, sparking the interest of innumerable people with its flawless layout and the annual
improvements made with the aid of manufacturers to revolutionise automobile design. Throughout the span of many many years, the shape, chassis, and components of
Formula 1 automobiles have undergone steady and repeated transformations, all geared toward accomplishing lighter and quicker overall performance. Among these
adjustments, one of the key elements that has substantially contributed to superior efficiency, not just in racing vehicles but additionally in standard vehicles,
is the evolution of aerodynamics in motorised cars.

Courting back to the late 1800s in France, motor racing has a very rich history as it has undergone continuous evolution, encompassing both the automobiles and the 
race tracks. As the popularity of racing grew, France delivered the first Grand Prix, organised via the Automobile Club of France, which then paved the way for other 
countries to host their own races. In the early days, race tracks had been entirely divergent from what we see nowadays, with races taking place on public, choppy 
terrain, sooner or later leading to the introduction of the famed Le Mans Grand Prix circuit. Regrettably, this later gained notoriety as one of the most perilous 
tracks in records, claiming the lives of many spectators and competitors over time. “The first global championship in motor racing was held in 1925 and consisted of 
four races: the Indianapolis 500, the Grand Prix of Europe, the French Grand Prix, and the Italian Grand Prix. In 1947, the Association Internationale des Automobile 
Clubs Reconnus underwent reorganisation, introducing new guidelines and transforming into the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). Finally, In 1950 the 
races all united to create a grand prix world championship for formula 1 drivers.”
